# Somewhat Off-Kilter Rideshare

This project is a sample application for use as a code test for Toca Boca. 

__TO BE CLEAR__: This is not an example of a well-built project, or indicative of how games are built at Toca Boca.

Its purpose is to provide a functional, if somewhat dysfunctional, codebase for candidates to start with rather than having to build an entire game from scratch.
